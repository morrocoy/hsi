Tabulated Molar Extinction Coefficient for Hemoglobin in Water

These values for the molar extinction coefficient e in [cm-1/(moles/liter)] were compiled by Scott Prahl (scott.prahl@oit.edu) using data from

W. B. Gratzer, Med. Res. Council Labs, Holly Hill, London
N. Kollias, Wellman Laboratories, Harvard Medical School, Boston

To convert this data to absorbance A, multiply by the molar concentration and the pathlength. For example, if x is the number of grams per liter
and a 1 cm cuvette is being used, then the absorbance is given by

        (e) [(1/cm)/(moles/liter)] (x) [g/liter] (1) [cm]
  A =  ---------------------------------------------------
                          64,500 [g/mole]

using 64,500 as the gram molecular weight of hemoglobin.

To convert this data to absorption coefficient in (cm-1), multiply by the molar concentration and 2.303,

Âµa = (2.303) e (x g/liter)/(64,500 g Hb/mole)

where x is the number of grams per liter. A typical value of x for whole blood is x=150 g Hb/liter.

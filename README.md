# hsi Package

HSI is user interface library for Python that provides functionality commonly
used for the analysis of hyperspectral data, in particularly, images data.
A vast of engineering and science applications profit from
hyperspectral imaging, such as in agriculture, medicin, or food
processing [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspectral_imaging/).

The modul library is particularly designed for clinical practice. Besides
general functionalities to deal with hyperspectral images, it provides
various algorithmes and methods to characterize tissue oxygenation and
other parameters that are of importance in supervising healing processes.

HSI makes use of the Qt GUI platform and PyQtGraph for scientific data
visualization. A number of widgets is provided for interactive analyses with
minimal effort.

It is known to run on Linux and Windows.
